# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-26)

**Core value:** Top-5 NL search precision ≥ 60% on the spike-001 query set, exposed as an open A2A endpoint that any agent can call.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 (Stack Spike) — storage backend pick (spike-008 pending)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Stack Spike)
Plan: — of 6 in current phase
Status: Storage backend spike pending (redb vs rusqlite+sqlite-vec — see §10.1 D-R1 + §9.6)
Last activity: 2026-04-27 — Phase 1 closed, entering Phase 2 storage spike

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 2026-04-26: Architecture pivot — pure Rust → Rust core (axum A2A) + Go service (chi/mcp-go/CLI). IPC = A2A protocol over localhost HTTP.
- 2026-04-26: License — MIT → Apache 2.0.
- 2026-04-26: Naming — Stitch → CodeNexus (locked).
- 2026-04-26: Embedder default — ollama-rs → candle.
- 2026-04-26: UI — pivoted Tauri → axum/Go-served web (option B).
- 2026-04-27: Phase 1 closed. ARCHITECTURE.md §9.1-§9.8 all locked. REQ-02 expanded to 4 edge kinds (Calls + Imports + Implements + Extends, Overrides Phase 3+). LLM-judge graded 0-3 N>=3 seeds primary metric (EVAL Rule 6). Path B Jina reranker NOT adopted (3 LLM-judge methodologies consistent — R5/R6/R6c).
- 2026-04-27: User directive — ship-it pivot. After Phase 2 storage spike, go straight to Phase 3 MVP build (axum A2A endpoint + Go MCP server + fat-binary). No more eval rounds unless explicitly requested.

### Pending Todos

- Phase 2 spike-008 pending: redb vs rusqlite+sqlite-vec storage backend benchmark

### Blockers/Concerns

- **A2A v0.2 spec stability** — if Google releases A2A v1.0 with breaking changes during MVP, we eat a refactor. Low-medium risk, mitigated by spec being public + small surface area we use.
- **candle model weight distribution** — Phase 2 spike must decide: bundle in binary (~80-120MB total) vs HuggingFace cache on first run. Affects cold-start UX.
- **mcp-go maintainer health** — Phase 2 spike sub-task to confirm release cadence + responsiveness.
- **Nomic Embed Code shadow eval blocked** — no-GPU on this host (per spike R5c). Retest needed on AU 5090.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| storage | redb vs rusqlite+sqlite-vec | **In progress** (spike-008 active, see .planning/research/storage_backend.md) | 2026-04-26 |
| distribution | cargo install / GH releases / homebrew | Post-MVP | 2026-04-26 |
| memU integration | self-contained vs shared PG (REQ-04 inherits self-contained default) | Phase 5 (Bridge) | 2026-04-26 |
| GitHub repo visibility | public-from-Phase-1 vs wait-for-MVP | Phase 1 wrap-up | 2026-04-26 |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-27 (Phase 1 closure + Phase 2 entry)
Stopped at: Phase 2 storage spike pending; Phase 3 A2A endpoint design doc landed
Resume file: .planning/research/a2a_endpoint.md (Phase 3 build-ready plan) + .planning/research/storage_backend.md (Phase 2 spike spec)

## Linear cross-reference

Linear project ID `5c8f1e26-c63d-4372-bcd9-4d94d04788a3` — renamed to **CodeNexus** on 2026-04-26. 44 issues now (XAR-224 → XAR-266 + XAR-270 new IPC spike) across 8 milestones.

**Synced state (2026-04-26 apply)**:

- Decisions milestone XAR-224 → 231: all 8 closed to Done with per-issue decision verdicts in description
- XAR-238 (rmcp spike): Canceled, replacement note points to mcp-go
- XAR-270 (new): Phase 2 (SPEC Phase 0) spike — A2A endpoint + Go-Rust IPC over A2A protocol, in Phase 0 Spike milestone

GSD `.planning/` canonical for phase-internal state; Linear canonical for milestone-level tracking. Sync script kept at `D:/projects/codenexus/scripts/linear_sync_decisions.py` for audit (single-shot, won't re-run).
