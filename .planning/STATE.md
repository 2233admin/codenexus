# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-26)

**Core value:** Top-5 NL search precision ≥ 60% on the spike-001 query set, exposed as an open A2A endpoint that any agent can call.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 (MVP) — REQ-06 ✓ done, REQ-07 Go server scaffold next

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 6 (MVP)
Plan: REQ-06 done (1 of 5)
Status: REQ-07 Go server scaffold next; REQ-08 fat-binary depends on REQ-07; REQ-09 UI depends on REQ-07
Last activity: 2026-04-27 — Phase 3 REQ-06 axum A2A endpoint green smoke (commit e0727c2)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 22% (Phase 1 closed + REQ-06 of 5 in Phase 3)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 2026-04-26: Architecture pivot — pure Rust → Rust core (axum A2A) + Go service (chi/mcp-go/CLI). IPC = A2A protocol over localhost HTTP.
- 2026-04-26: License — MIT → Apache 2.0.
- 2026-04-26: Naming — Stitch → CodeNexus (locked).
- 2026-04-26: Embedder default — ollama-rs → candle.
- 2026-04-26: UI — pivoted Tauri → axum/Go-served web (option B).
- 2026-04-27: Phase 1 closed. ARCHITECTURE.md §9.1-§9.8 all locked. REQ-02 expanded to 4 edge kinds (Calls + Imports + Implements + Extends, Overrides Phase 3+). LLM-judge graded 0-3 N>=3 seeds primary metric (EVAL Rule 6). Path B Jina reranker NOT adopted (3 LLM-judge methodologies consistent — R5/R6/R6c).
- 2026-04-27: User directive — ship-it pivot. After Phase 2 storage spike, go straight to Phase 3 MVP build (axum A2A endpoint + Go MCP server + fat-binary). No more eval rounds unless explicitly requested.
- 2026-04-27: Phase 2 storage spike SKIPPED — research-conclusive verdict (rusqlite+sqlite-vec) per .planning/research/storage_backend.md; micro-bench recommended but not blocking; ship-it directive prefers building over re-validating.
- 2026-04-27: REQ-06 A2A endpoint ✓ — commit e0727c2; axum 0.7 + tokio 1.40 + 3 new src/ files (a2a, server, task_state); 4 operations (Query/GetSymbol/ListCallers/IndexRepo) working end-to-end; smoke green on existing poc.db (52 files / 2116 symbols / 877+ edges).

### Pending Todos

- REQ-07 Go server scaffold (chi + mark3labs/mcp-go + cobra): server/{go.mod,main.go,cmd/serve.go,internal/...}
- REQ-08 fat-binary go:embed Rust binary inside Go (depends on REQ-07)
- REQ-09 embedded HTML/JS UI vanilla + HTMX + cytoscape.js (depends on REQ-07)
- REQ-10 MVP precision ≥ 60% measurement on spike-001 7-query baseline (after REQ-06 stack runs)
- (deferred) Phase 2 storage micro-bench: optional Criterion harness on insert/lookup/vector top-5/FTS5; skip per ship-it directive
- (deferred) Nomic Embed Code shadow re-test on AU 5090 host (CPU segfault here)

### Blockers/Concerns

- **A2A v0.2 spec stability** — if Google releases A2A v1.0 with breaking changes during MVP, we eat a refactor. Low-medium risk, mitigated by spec being public + small surface area we use.
- **candle model weight distribution** — Phase 2 spike must decide: bundle in binary (~80-120MB total) vs HuggingFace cache on first run. Affects cold-start UX.
- **mcp-go maintainer health** — Phase 2 spike sub-task to confirm release cadence + responsiveness.
- **Nomic Embed Code shadow eval blocked** — no-GPU on this host (per spike R5c). Retest needed on AU 5090.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| storage | redb vs rusqlite+sqlite-vec | **In progress** (spike-008 active, see .planning/research/storage_backend.md) | 2026-04-26 |
| distribution | cargo install / GH releases / homebrew | Post-MVP | 2026-04-26 |
| memU integration | self-contained vs shared PG (REQ-04 inherits self-contained default) | Phase 5 (Bridge) | 2026-04-26 |
| GitHub repo visibility | public-from-Phase-1 vs wait-for-MVP | Phase 1 wrap-up | 2026-04-26 |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-27 (R5 → Phase 3 REQ-06, 11 commits, ship-it pivot done)
Stopped at: Phase 3 REQ-06 ✓ green smoke; REQ-07 Go server scaffold pending
Resume file: progress.txt (root) + this STATE.md
Next-session entry: user says "继续" or "REQ-07" → write Go scaffold per ARCHITECTURE.md §3+§5+§7 + REQ-07 acceptance

## Linear cross-reference

Linear project ID `5c8f1e26-c63d-4372-bcd9-4d94d04788a3` — renamed to **CodeNexus** on 2026-04-26. 44 issues now (XAR-224 → XAR-266 + XAR-270 new IPC spike) across 8 milestones.

**Synced state (2026-04-26 apply)**:

- Decisions milestone XAR-224 → 231: all 8 closed to Done with per-issue decision verdicts in description
- XAR-238 (rmcp spike): Canceled, replacement note points to mcp-go
- XAR-270 (new): Phase 2 (SPEC Phase 0) spike — A2A endpoint + Go-Rust IPC over A2A protocol, in Phase 0 Spike milestone

GSD `.planning/` canonical for phase-internal state; Linear canonical for milestone-level tracking. Sync script kept at `D:/projects/codenexus/scripts/linear_sync_decisions.py` for audit (single-shot, won't re-run).
